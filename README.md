# Breast-Cancer-Mortality-Survival-Prediction

The development of this classification model aims to tackle a real-world tool by developing effective early screening machine learning models for breast cancer mortality and survival prediction to help doctors nhance their treatment planning and management. Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Breast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left nchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal. Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milk producing lobules of the breast. In females in the UK, breast cancer is the 2nd ost common cause of cancer death, with around 11,400 deaths every year (2017-2019). In males in the UK, breast cancer is not among the 20 most common causes of cancer death, with around 85 deaths every year (2017-2019)
